base64:
When binary data is decoded from binary64data, it is first split into groups of four characters. Each group of four characters is then converted into a 6-bit Base64 digit. The four Base64 digits are then concatenated together to form a single block of 24 bits. The block of 24 bits is then decoded into its original binary form.
Binary64data is a convenient way to transmit binary data over a network because it can be easily encoded and decoded. It is also a secure way to transmit binary data because it cannot be easily read by humans.
